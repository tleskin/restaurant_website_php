<h2>Above all else, Sheetz is about providing kicked-up convenience while being more than just a convenience store. <br>
Sheetz is a mecca for people on the go. If you need to refuel your car or refresh your body,<br> 
we have what you need to keep you moving on to whatever comes next.<br>
Road warriors. Construction workers. Soccer moms. They all have a special place at Sheetz. <br>
We know you don't have time to run all over town for the things you need. <br>
Sheetz has what you need, when you need it. And, we're here 24/7/365. Even on Christmas day.<br></h2>

<h1>Committed to our communities</h1>

<h2>We connect with our neighbors in a number of ways and through various charitable organizations like Special Olympics,<br>
 youth sports groups and For the Kidz.<br>

Sheetz employees started For the Kidz in 1992. 
Since then, we have raised millions of dollars to buy toys, clothes and other necessities for <br>
needy children during the holiday season.<br>
 It's a charity that is very near and dear to our hearts, and our employees work hard to raise more <br>
 money and help even more children each year.<br></h2>

<h1>Fresh, quick, "Made To Order" food</h1><!-- this is a different font and size called from the stylesheet.-->

<h2>Here at Sheetz, we pride ourselves in the different food choices we have to offer, from hot dogs to salads to<br>
Mexican food to our numerous appetizers.<br>

Our newest feature is that you can now place your order online through our Order page<br>
then pay for it through our Billing page. It will then be ready for you to pick up when you arrive at the store.<br>
If you leave us your mobile number, we will even send you a text once it's ready. <br></h2>
